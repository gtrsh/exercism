    1. Passwords are hard to update
    2. You have to input the current password to set a new one
    3. We would need to notify user by email about the password change
    4. All sessions are killed, we will need to restore at least one manually
    5. We already have a change-password mechanics

    You also cannot change 'email': it is our main identifier.
